========

A data structures library that focuses on readability and portability.

This library grants access to three data structures (possibly more to come, I
don't know), linked lists, hash maps, and patricia tries.

Installation
============

There are no dependencies other than a somewhat capable c standard library and
cmake for building.

Once you clone this repository, from the root of the repository, run the
following:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    # make install

This will install this library with the prefix /usr/local so you may also need
to run `ldconfig` as root to build other software with this.
